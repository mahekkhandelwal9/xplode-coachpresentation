The Reality Check 
Running a cricket academy shouldn't feel like herding cats. Yet here we are. 
Attendance Chaos 
WhatsApp groups, paper registers, missed 
sessionsΓÇötracking who shows up is a daily headache 
that wastes valuable coaching time. Feedback Black Hole 
Video analysis stuck on your phone. Players forget 
corrections. Parents demand updates you haven't got 
time to send individually. 
Progress Mystery 
No clear records of improvement. Parents question 
value. Players lose motivation. Renewals become 
difficult conversations. Communication Overload 
Endless messages about schedules, fees, weather 
cancellationsΓÇödrowning in admin when you should be 
coaching champions.
