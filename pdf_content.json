Yet here we are. \nAttendance Chaos \nWhatsApp groups, paper registers, missed \nsessions—tracking who shows up is a daily headache \nthat wastes valuable coaching time. Feedback Black Hole \nVideo analysis stuck on your phone. Players forget \ncorrections. Parents demand updates you haven't got \ntime to send individually. \nProgress Mystery \nNo clear records of improvement. Parents question \nvalue. Players lose motivation. Renewals become \ndifficult conversations. Communication Overload \nEndless messages about schedules, fees, weather \ncancellations—drowning in admin when you should be \ncoaching champions. "
